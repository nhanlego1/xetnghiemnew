About

This adds a new display style to views called "WaterFall". Similar to how you
 select "HTML List" or "Unformatted List" as display styles.

This module apply waterFall js from 
http://www.jqueryscript.net/layout/Pinterest-Style-Responsive-Web-Layout-Plugin-For-jQuery-newWaterfall-js.html

This module doesn't require Views UI to be enabled but it is required if you 
want to configure your Views display using WaterFall through the web interface. 
This ensures you can leave Views UI off once everything is setup.

Usage
=====

Go to Views and Use the display mode "Waterfall"

You can edit the width of the box in the file newWaterfall.js.
var defaults = {
                width: 320,
                delay: 60,
                repeatShow: false
               };
